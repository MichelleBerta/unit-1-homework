# Refactoring A Website

This first homework assignment.was to refactor an existing website. Refactoring a website makes it more efficient and easier to maintain.

The first steps taken in refactoring this webiste was to change the html tags to semantic tags. Semantic tags clearly label each part of a website making it easier for both people and browsers to identify.

Another step in refactoring a website is to make it more accessible. I included alt tags for each of the images included so that vision impaired hear a description of the image.

Once changes were made to the html page, the css page was updated to reflect the necessary tags. In addition repetative coding was combined to reduce and simplify the amount of code on the style page.

Notes were added to both the html and css pages to help identify code for future purposes.

By working through this assignment I gained a better understanding of properly setting up html sturcture and how to simpllify and more efficiently write css coding.
